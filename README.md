# CREG-MT-eval
Corpus of Reading Comprehension Exercises in German (CREG)
Machine Translation Evaluation version (CREG-MT-eval)

CREG-MT-eval is a version of CREG corpus machine translated by four different 
MT systems. The systems are:
- MOSES: a baseline SMT system (http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=moses.baseline)
- Google: https://translate.google.co.uk/
- Bing: https://www.bing.com/translator/
- SYSTRAN: a RBMT system (http://www.systransoft.com/)

36 documents were also translated by a professional translator in order to be used as oracle
translations. 

There is also an extra MT version called 'Mixed', where the documents contain sentences
from different MT systems. 

We also provide the original and post-edited questions per document. 

## RELEASE

This release contains 108 documents machine translated by the systems mentioned above,
as presented in the work of:

Carolina Scarton and Lucia Specia (2016): A Reading Comprehension Corpus for Machine Translation Evaluation.
In Proceedings of the 10th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference. Portorož, Slovenia.

## Original CREG corpus

CREG is a corpus built by researchers from the [University of Tübingen](http://www.uni-tuebingen.de). It is composed by documents of different genre and size and each document has reading comprehension tests associated to it. Target answers for the questions are also provided.
Different versions of this corpus have been made available and they also work on a Corpus of Reading Comprehesion in English.
