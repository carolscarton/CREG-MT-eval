CREG-mt-eval is a version of CREG corpus machine translated by four different 
MT systems. The systems are:
- MOSES: a baseline SMT system (http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=moses.baseline)
- Google: https://translate.google.co.uk/
- Bing: https://www.bing.com/translator/
- SYSTRAN: a RBMT system (http://www.systransoft.com/)

36 documents were also translated by a professional translator in order to be used as oracle
translations. 

There is also an extra MT version called 'Mixed', where the documents contain sentences
from different MT systems. 

We also provide the original and post-edited questions per document.
